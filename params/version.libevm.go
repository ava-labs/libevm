// LibEVMVersion holds the textual version string of `libevm` modifications.
//
// Although compliant with [semver v2], it follows additional rules:
//
//  1. Major, minor, and patch MUST be the respective `geth` values;
//  2. The first three pre-release identifiers MUST be a semver-compliant
//     triplet denoting the `libevm` "version";
//  3. On the `main` (development) branch, the final identifier MUST be "alpha"
//     or "beta";
//  3. If a production version, the final identifier MUST be "release"; and
//  4. If a release candidate, the final two identifiers MUST be "rc" and an
//     incrementing numeric value.
//
// The benefits of this pattern are that (a) it captures all relevant
// information; and (b) it follows an intuitive ordering under semver rules.
// Precedence is determined first by the `geth` version then the `libevm`
// version, with release candidates being lower than actual releases.
//
// The primary drawbacks is that it requires an explicit "release" identifier
// because of the use of pre-release identifiers to capture the `libevm`
// triplet.
